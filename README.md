# 🌍 **Disaster Relief Resource Management CRM (ReliefConnect)**

---

## **Problem Statement**

When natural disasters (floods, cyclones, earthquakes) hit India, **aid distribution becomes chaotic**:

* Relief camps lack real-time info about food, medicine, and shelter availability.
* NGOs and government agencies **duplicate efforts** or miss critical areas.
* Victims often don’t know **where to go for help**.
* There is **no central system** to match urgent needs with available relief resources.

This results in **delays, wastage of supplies, and preventable suffering**.

---

## **Proposed Salesforce Solution — ReliefConnect**

A Salesforce-based **Disaster Relief Resource CRM** that:

1. Lets **field volunteers log on-ground needs (food, medicine, shelter requests)** via a mobile LWC intake form (offline + online).
2. Creates **Relief\_Case\_\_c records** with location, urgency level, and category.
3. Matches **needs with donors/NGOs** using Flows + Apex (like Uber, but for relief).
4. Integrates with **Map APIs (AppExchange: MapAnything/Geopointe)** for **heatmaps of affected areas**.
5. Triggers **alerts to nearest NGOs/government agencies** when critical shortages are detected.
6. Uses **Einstein AI** to forecast shortages (e.g., “Medicine demand will exceed supply in X camp within 48 hrs”).
7. Provides **dashboards for central command centers** (NGOs/govt) to monitor SLA compliance, supply-demand balance, and camp status.

# **Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis**

### **1. Requirement Gathering**

* **Victims/Survivors**: Need quick info on nearest camp and assurance that essential supplies exist.
* **Volunteers/Field Staff**: Need a quick way to log urgent needs on mobile devices (poor connectivity areas).
* **NGOs/Donors**: Need visibility of where their supplies are needed most.
* **Government Agencies**: Need dashboards to coordinate multiple NGOs and avoid duplication.

📌 **Deliverable → Requirement Doc** (Intake Form, Urgency Scoring, Donor Matching, Geo Mapping, AI Forecasting, Dashboards).

### **2. Stakeholder Analysis**

| Stakeholder       | Role       | Pain Point                                      | What They Gain                         |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Survivors/Victims | End users  | No visibility on nearest help, lack of supplies | Info + faster help                     |
| Volunteers        | Frontline  | Manual reporting, poor connectivity             | Mobile LWC, offline logging            |
| NGOs/Donors       | Providers  | Lack of real-time needs visibility              | Transparent matching + impact tracking |
| Govt Agencies     | Regulators | No coordination, duplication of aid             | Central dashboards + AI forecasting    |

📌 **Deliverable → Stakeholder Map (Influence vs Interest).**

### **3. Business Process Mapping**

**As-Is (Manual)**

* Volunteer notes needs on paper/WhatsApp → delays → duplicate donations → people left without essentials.

**To-Be (Salesforce Automated)**

1. Volunteer logs need in Salesforce LWC → Urgency Score auto-calculated.
2. Relief\_Case\_\_c created with Category (Food/Medicine/Shelter).
3. Flow routes case to **nearest NGO/Donor queue**.
4. Apex trigger sends **SMS/WhatsApp via Twilio** to donors + command center.
5. NGO marks supplies delivered → Einstein AI updates forecast for shortages.
6. Command center dashboard shows **heatmap of active needs + SLA compliance**.

📌 **Deliverable → BPMN Diagram (Need Logging → Scoring → Routing → Notification → Fulfillment → Reporting).**

### **4. Industry-Specific Use Case Analysis**

* **Scenario 1 – Smart Resource Allocation**
  *As a government officer*, I want a live dashboard of supply vs demand by district so I can reallocate resources.
  ✅ Value: Prevents shortages and wastage.

* **Scenario 2 – Urgent Case Prioritization**
  *As a volunteer*, I want high-urgency needs (medical, infants, elderly) flagged automatically so they reach help faster.
  ✅ Value: Saves lives by reducing delay.

* **Scenario 3 – Donor Transparency**
  *As a donor*, I want reports of how my supplies were used so I can ensure accountability.
  ✅ Value: Increases trust and funding.

* **Scenario 4 – Predictive Analytics**
  *As a relief coordinator*, I want AI to forecast food/medicine shortages so I can pre-position supplies.
  ✅ Value: Proactive crisis management.

### **5. AppExchange Exploration**

* **Geopointe / MapAnything** → Location heatmaps & routing.
* **Twilio for Salesforce** → SMS/WhatsApp alerts.
* **Survey Force** → Collect survivor feedback post-relief.
* **Nonprofit Success Pack (NPSP)** → NGO donation + volunteer management.
